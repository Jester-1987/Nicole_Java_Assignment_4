# Nicole_Java_Assignment_4
Final Java Assignment

- Added two new weapon types: *Rusty Trusty Spoon* and *Cannon*! (One underpowered one overpowered)
- Added two new armour types: *Potato Sack* and *Adamantium* (I know this wasnâ€™t asked for, but I felt balance was needed).
- Fixed issue with Warrior health falling below 0 in stats screen when they are defeated (see Warrior.java). This was just bugging me and I wanted to fix it.
- Added Weather Package and three children: Sunny, Fog, SnowStorm
